# Elixir in The Jungle

## Part 2 - The VPC, and the Bastion

To use these files, you must:
1. Have Terraform 0.12.6
1. Generate privileged AWS credentials. (define required cred, ec2, s3, iam)
1. Add generated access key, and access key id to the `./.env` file.
1. Add your user and public key to the `users` section of `cloud_init.tpl`
1. Create a private S3 bucket, with versioning enabled, to use for Terraform Remote State etc (and add the name of the bucket to the `main.tf` files in each directory)

- `terraform init` will initialize the backend etc
- `terraform workspace new example` create a new workspace, the expected
   workspace name for the files in this config is `example`
- `terraform plan` will describe what changes are needed
- `terraform apply` will apply the changes


### Teardown

Use `terraform destroy` to tear down all of the created infrastructure.

If you have objects in the S3 build bucket, Terraform will not be able to destroy the bucket.

You will need to empty the bucket, or remove it by hand via the AWS console.
